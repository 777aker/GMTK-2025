This is the repo for a game for the 2025 GMTK game jam.

The theme is "LOOP".

I've been obsessed with Chess lately so gonna make some kind of chess game.

Ideas:

- knitting and crocheting: have loops, thread crosses over itself, white black
- loops up and down the chess board
- ground hog day chess: same game over and over, less and less moves
- chess dating game where all the pieces are gay and you call it fruit loops and it's secretly through the looking glass fan fiction
- rollcoasters have loops: rollar coaster tycoon but all the people are chess pieces, make it so pieces can get in
- blender bowling alley: strike nonsense animations
- connected chess boards that teleport back and forth (portal?)
- chess puzzles super hot style
- pawn that moves in loop and destroys everything
- looping chess instructions: programming chess, for loop pieces, baba is you, all move at same time
- looss
- always playing against self
- right moves = unlimited moves: links melody unlocks stuff
- get to task faster than opponent, make sacrifices
- song on loop when it ends you stop, each song = one chess piece 
- chess squares play a note
- chess but secrets, get a secret next to another piece, hidden board game info, fog of war chess
- loop through pieces, can't pick which one
- doughnut chess board
- drawback chess
- heroscape style pick pieces you're going to loop through
- normal crazy normal debuff normal crazy.....looping
- chess goes through weirdmagedon acid trip
- mini coops have a lot of circles (ie loops)
- all of their pieces randomly move
- random number of their pieces move randomly or toward king
- looping through the same game but stranger and stranger things happen
- loading screens are kinda a loop / often have loops in them (idk what to do with that info)
